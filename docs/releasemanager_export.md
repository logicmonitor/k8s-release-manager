## releasemanager export

Export Helm release state

### Synopsis

Release Manager Export will contact the configured cluster, collect
all metadata for each deployed release, and write that metadata to the
configured backend. This metadata can later be consumed by Release Manager
import to re-install the saved releases to a different cluster.

Export can also be run in daemon mode to continuously update the stored state to
reflect ongoing changes to the cluster.

Installing releasemanager daemon via Helm chart
helm repo add logicmonitor https://logicmonitor.github.io/k8s-helm-charts
helm install logicmonitor/releasemanager \
 --set path=$BACKEND_STORAGE_PATH \
  --name releasemanager-$CURRENT_CLUSTER

When running in daemon mode, it is HIGHLY recommended when running to use the
official Release Manager Helm chart. Failing to specify --release-name or
use the official Helm chart can lead to multiple Release Manager instances
writing state to the same backend path, causing conflicts, overwrites chaos.

### Options

```
      --daemon                 Run in daemon mode and periodically export the current state
  -p, --polling-interval int   Specify, in seconds, how frequently the daemon should export the current state (default 30)
      --release-name string    Specify the Release Manager daemon's Helm release name
```

      --path string               Required. Use this path within the backend for state storage
